# ðŸš¨ DEVELOPMENT RULES - MANDATORY CONSULTATION

## CRITICAL: Read this file BEFORE any code modification

### CODE PRESERVATION PROTOCOL

1. **ADDITIVE ONLY**: Never delete or modify existing functional code
2. **ZERO REMOVAL**: All working features, UI, UX, business logic must remain intact
3. **PRESERVE DEPENDENCIES**: Keep all imports, providers, components, and logic
4. **ASK WHEN UNCLEAR**: If ambiguous, keep existing functionality and ask for clarification
5. **STOP IF BREAKING**: If cannot implement without breaking existing code, HALT and describe issue
6. **CHECK LOGS**: Always consult Logtail logger for errors
7. **CONFIRM RULES**: Always acknowledge following these rules

### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `search_replace` for surgical changes
- Read complete file before editing
- Verify component dependencies
- Add new code alongside existing
- Use composition over modification

### VIOLATION IMPACT

- User loses hours of work
- Functional features break
- Development velocity severely impacted

### CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

Must state "I will follow CODE_PRESERVATION_PROTOCOL" before any code changes.
